  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Talk with Saints-AI (“the App”) does not require you to provide personal information 
      such as your name, email, or phone number.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We may collect non-personal information automatically, such as device type, operating system, 
      and usage statistics, for the purpose of improving the App.  
    </p>
    <p>
      If you interact with the AI chatbot, your questions and conversations may be processed 
      temporarily to generate responses. These are not stored permanently by us.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">

      <li>Ensure the App functions as intended.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties.  
      If third-party services are integrated (e.g., analytics, crash reporting, or AI APIs), 
      they may process data under their own privacy policies.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App may use third-party services (such as AI models, hosting providers, or analytics tools). 
      These services may collect information as governed by their own privacy policies.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable steps to protect your information. However, no system is 100% secure, 
      and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not directed to children under 13 years of age.
